# Assignment 1
__Problem Introduction__

In this challenge, you will be given the task of performing Genome Assembly on a simulated error-free sequencing dataset. 

__Problem Description__

Given a list of error-free reads, perform the task of Genome Assembly and return the circular genome from which they came. 
__Dataset__

Each of 1618 lines of the input contains a single read, that is, a string over {A, C, G, T}. The reads are given to you in alphabetical order because their true order is hidden from you. 

Each read is 100 nucleotides long and contains no sequencing errors. 

Note that you are not given the 100-mer composition of the genome, i.e., some 100-mers may be missing.


__Output__


Output the assembled genome on a single line.

## Generate artificial error-free reads for testing
