Input: reads (several lines)
1. Generate paired_reads from reads
2. Generate paired de Bruijn graph (paired_dB_graph) from paired_reads
3. Construct string from paired_dB_graph
4. Spell the path into text

Circular plasmids
What the reads will be
    if linked everything together -> circular -> find a start, end will be the vertex before start

Circular plasmid -> form eulerian cycle
